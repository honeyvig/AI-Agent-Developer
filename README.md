# AI-Agent-Developer
 create an AI-driven system for managing end-to-end content creation and publishing tasks. This project involves building a team of AI
Agents capable of the following:

+ Google Scraping: Extract data based on a provided list of keywords.
+ Website Analysis: Analyze selected websites to generate a comprehensive content plan for articles.
+ Content Writing: Produce high-quality, SEO-optimized articles based on the generated content plan.
+ Image Design: Create visually appealing images using AI tools and incorporate relevant YouTube video embeds into the articles.
+ Article Compilation and Publishing: Assemble the article with all media elements and upload it as a draft to our WordPress site.

------------------
To create an AI-driven system for managing end-to-end content creation and publishing tasks, we can break down the project into several key components that will work together to automate the process of content creation and publishing on a WordPress site. The core components will include:

    Google Scraping: Extract relevant data based on a list of keywords from search results.
    Website Analysis: Analyze selected websites to generate a content plan.
    Content Writing: Use AI to generate SEO-optimized articles.
    Image Design: Generate images and integrate relevant YouTube videos.
    Article Compilation and Publishing: Assemble articles and upload them as drafts to WordPress.

We will use Python for most tasks and integrate it with popular AI libraries and services. Here is a Python code structure that could serve as the backbone for such a system.
Step 1: Google Scraping using googlesearch-python

We will extract data based on provided keywords using the googlesearch-python library, which provides simple access to Google Search results.

pip install googlesearch-python

from googlesearch import search

def google_scraping(keywords, num_results=10):
    search_results = []
    for keyword in keywords:
        query = f"{keyword} site:*.com"
        results = search(query, num_results=num_results)
        search_results.append(results)
    return search_results

keywords = ["AI content creation", "SEO writing tips", "WordPress automation"]
results = google_scraping(keywords)
print(results)

Step 2: Website Analysis using BeautifulSoup and Requests

Once we have the URLs from Google Scraping, we can use BeautifulSoup to scrape and analyze the content of selected websites.

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def analyze_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    # Extract title, headings, paragraphs, etc.
    title = soup.title.string
    headings = [h.get_text() for h in soup.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3'])]
    paragraphs = [p.get_text() for p in soup.find_all('p')]
    
    return {
        "title": title,
        "headings": headings,
        "paragraphs": paragraphs
    }

url = "https://example.com"
website_data = analyze_website(url)
print(website_data)

Step 3: Content Writing using OpenAI GPT-3 (or GPT-4)

For generating SEO-optimized content, we can use OpenAI's GPT models. To generate SEO-optimized content, we can provide a content outline and prompt the model to create the article based on the analysis.

pip install openai

import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def generate_article(content_plan):
    prompt = f"Write an SEO-optimized article based on the following content plan: {content_plan}"
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Or "gpt-4" if available
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1500
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

content_plan = "1. Introduction to AI content creation, 2. Best practices for SEO writing, 3. Tools for automating content, 4. Conclusion."
article = generate_article(content_plan)
print(article)

Step 4: Image Design using DALL·E or Other AI Image Generators

For creating visually appealing images, we can integrate an image generation API like DALL·E (by OpenAI) or use a service like DeepAI for generating images from text prompts.

pip install openai

import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def generate_image(prompt):
    response = openai.Image.create(
        prompt=prompt,
        n=1,
        size="1024x1024"
    )
    return response['data'][0]['url']

image_prompt = "An image of a modern office with a computer displaying an AI model"
image_url = generate_image(image_prompt)
print(f"Generated image URL: {image_url}")

Step 5: YouTube Video Embedding

To embed relevant YouTube videos into the article, we can use the google-api-python-client to search YouTube and retrieve the video embed URL.

pip install google-api-python-client

from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def get_youtube_video_url(query):
    youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey='your-youtube-api-key')
    
    request = youtube.search().list(
        part="snippet",
        q=query,
        type="video"
    )
    response = request.execute()
    
    video_id = response['items'][0]['id']['videoId']
    video_url = f"https://www.youtube.com/embed/{video_id}"
    return video_url

video_url = get_youtube_video_url("AI content creation tutorial")
print(f"YouTube Video Embed URL: {video_url}")

Step 6: Article Compilation and Publishing to WordPress

To interact with WordPress and publish the article, we can use the WordPress REST API.

pip install wordpress-api

from wordpress_api import WordPressAPI

wp = WordPressAPI(
    url="https://yourwordpresssite.com",
    consumer_key="your_consumer_key",
    consumer_secret="your_consumer_secret"
)

def create_wordpress_draft(title, content, image_url, video_url):
    article = {
        'title': title,
        'content': f"<p>{content}</p><img src='{image_url}'><iframe src='{video_url}'></iframe>",
        'status': 'draft'
    }
    wp.posts.create(article)

title = "AI Content Creation: A Complete Guide"
content = article  # The content generated from GPT-3
image_url = image_url  # Image generated from DALL·E
video_url = video_url  # Video URL retrieved from YouTube
create_wordpress_draft(title, content, image_url, video_url)

Step 7: Putting It All Together

We can create a Python script that automates the full flow: from scraping data, analyzing websites, generating content, creating images, embedding videos, and publishing the final article to WordPress.

def main():
    # Step 1: Google Scraping
    keywords = ["AI content creation", "SEO writing tips", "WordPress automation"]
    search_results = google_scraping(keywords)
    
    # Step 2: Website Analysis
    for url in search_results[0]:  # Example: Just processing the first keyword's results
        website_data = analyze_website(url)
    
    # Step 3: Generate SEO-Optimized Article
    content_plan = "1. Introduction to AI content creation, 2. Best practices for SEO writing, 3. Tools for automating content, 4. Conclusion."
    article = generate_article(content_plan)
    
    # Step 4: Generate Image
    image_prompt = "An image of AI writing an article on a computer"
    image_url = generate_image(image_prompt)
    
    # Step 5: Get YouTube Video Embed URL
    video_url = get_youtube_video_url("AI content creation tutorial")
    
    # Step 6: Publish to WordPress
    create_wordpress_draft("AI Content Creation: A Complete Guide", article, image_url, video_url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Final Notes:

    Google Scraping: Ensure you comply with Google’s terms of service and consider using Google Custom Search API if scraping large amounts of data.
    WordPress API: You can customize the post creation process to handle categories, tags, and custom post types.
    AI Models: Fine-tune AI models if necessary to fit specific content needs.

This Python-based solution provides a comprehensive automation pipeline for content creation and publishing. It can be further optimized, extended with additional features, or deployed as a production-grade system with user interfaces and cloud-based solutions for scaling.
